# notocord_mpi
Matlab code for interacting with notocord MPI20a module. Note, this code does not support the older MPI10a module. 

The MPI20a module offers better speed than the MPI10a module although the interface is still not great. The main update that warrants its use is that it allows for writing of markers.

This code is not in active development as I don't currently use Notocord.
